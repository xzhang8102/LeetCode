# Notes

## Simple Problems with optimal solutions

### Array

### Bit Manipulation

### Binary Tree

### Go Specifics

#### in-order / post-order tree traversal using BFS (iterative)
The iterative solution mimics the call stack of the recursive one.  
The key is `stack := []interface{}{}` which saves memory from declaring a `map` of visited nodes.

Example: [lc606](../golang/lc606ConstructStringFromBinaryTree.go)

## Typical Data Structure

### Trie

### Union Find
